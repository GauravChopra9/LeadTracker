A chrome extension coded in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to develop a user interface that can save a list of URL's of the current tab and window. The extenison calls the chrome API to get the URL of the current tab and window. It saves the URLs in the webs local storage so the list still persists even after closing and revisitng the chrome extension. There is a delete button to clear the local storgage when needed. It uses the DOM to make the extension interactive.
